# Take-Home Exercise

This is a small Next.js app built as part of a take-home exercise.

The focus was on keeping the structure simple and clear, using modern Next.js patterns, and staying within the suggested timebox rather than building out a large feature set.

## Overview
- Root page shows a user profile with a feed of posts below it
- Individual posts are accessible via a dynamic route

## Tech
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

## Notes
- Data is mocked and loaded on the server
- The feed is rendered as an async component
- Some features were intentionally left out to keep scope tight

## Running locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
